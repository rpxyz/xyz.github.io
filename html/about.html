Hey, I am Ryan and first of all I'd like to welcome you to my Blog which was custom made by myself using the bootstrap engine <b><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a></b>
and which is hosted by <b><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a></b>. This Blog is where I frequently post opinions on things that interest me especially in and around China.
China is a place close to my heart and has been the place where I have now been living for the past fifteen years. I am originaly from 
the United Kingdom I first came to China in 2004 to work as an English teacher. I'm also a keen photographer in which I share most of 
my shots on my personal <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ryxn.visualz/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></b>. 
<p><p>
My main reason for this Blog was that I was getting tired of how people from the west have come to perceive China especially the western
media who seem to have a hate campaign against everything that China does. I would often spend hours each day replying to comments in 
news reports about China on Facebook or videos on YouTube where the hateful comments are common. Why do I do this maybe you wonder? 
well first of all on social media China does not have a voice and have you ever noticed you never see anything positive about China being 
spoken of in the western news. Many Chinese are shy or do not really know how to express themselves in this situation and would often be
mocked for their comments on such things, I myself have even been called a fake and Chinese spy. It's like the western people are too far
gone and that brainwashed that they do not want to listen, only hate exists so it seems.
<p><p>
Why would I write a Blog or even comment on such things on social media? well I for one have lived in China long enough to know the facts 
and as a foreigner living here it's better coming from my voice instead of a Chinese person who would of course do so in love of his/her country 
even if it was right or wrong. I am not biased and would of course point out facts with reasoning, I've nothing to gain here, all I want is 
the world to know the real China and to see how it really is from a foreigners perspective.
