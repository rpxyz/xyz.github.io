Hey guys welcome to my blog, this is just going to be a quick post as I have made a more detailed (about) page <b>[here](/about/)</b>. Right now I am stuck in the UK waiting
to return to China once the flight restrictions are lifted, I originally came here just before the virus hit and so been stuck here ever since. I've used all 
my free time to not only make this blog but also pass my Chinese HSK exam and renew all of my documents for the next ten years. So once I do leave here I have nothing
to really worry about for sometime. Really can't wait to return back to China though, I miss it terribly.

The blog itself will be updated as much as I can, I also plan to make my own YouTube channel I'll keep you all posted about that here so keep your eyes open.

Anyway, thanks for passing by, be sure to check out that about page linked above and I hope to speak to you all in the comments at some point.

Ryan
